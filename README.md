# Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition
â€¢ Description: Developed a smart attendance system using Python that automates student attendance tracking. The system allows new student registration, generates daily attendance sheets for each lecture, and produces two detailed reports. It automatically sends reports to the department head and notifies parents via email if a student is absent.
